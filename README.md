Our system is an API which is connected to a backend server.  The API can receive requests to upload, update, download, and rate individual packages.  The API itself is hosted in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) App Engine, and the database is hosted in GCP BigQuery.  Users can interact with the API like any other API, using Postman, cURL, a custom script, within their application, or through any other interface.  Admins can register users, who can then request access tokens using their personal login information.  Packages can be uploaded via base64 encoded string of the .zip contents, or ingested via URL.  Downloaded packages are provided in base64 form.
